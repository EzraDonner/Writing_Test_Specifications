// Unit Tests:

// A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

//    - Expect `multiplication(2, 3)` to be a number.
//    - Expect `multiplication(2, 3)` to equal 6.
//    - Expect `multiplication(-2, 3)` to equal -6.
//    - Expect `multiplication(0, 3)` to equal 0.
//    - Expect `multiplication(2.5, 3)` to equal 7.5.
//    - Expect `multiplication(2, "a")` to be an error.
//    - Expect `multiplication(null, 5)` to be an error.
//    - Expect `multiplication(undefined, 3)` to be an error.

// A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

//    - Expect `concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])` to return `[-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]`.
//    - Expect `concatOdds([], [2, 4, 6])` to return an empty array `[]`.
//    - Expect `concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [])` to return an empty array `[]`.
//    - Expect `concatOdds([3, 7], [5, 9])` to return `[3, 5, 7, 9]`.
//    - Expect `concatOdds([3, 7, -3], [-5, 9])` to return `[-5, -3, 3, 7, 9]`.
//    - Expect `concatOdds([1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 5])` to return `[1, 3, 5]` (duplicate odds should not appear more than once).
//    - Expect `concatOdds([1, "a", 3], [9, null])` to be an error.
//    - Expect `concatOdds(["a", "b"], [2, 4])` to be an error.

// Functional Tests:

// 1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

//    - When a user tries to check out with an empty cart, they should be shown a message indicating that the cart is empty and should not be allowed to proceed with the checkout.
//    - When a logged-in user proceeds to checkout, they should see a summary of their order, including item details, quantities, prices, and a total amount.
//    - When a guest user proceeds to checkout, they should be asked if they want to create an account or continue as a guest.
//    - When a guest user continues as a guest, they should be prompted to enter their shipping and payment information.
//    - When a user chooses to create an account during checkout, they should be taken to a registration form, and upon completion, should be redirected back to the checkout process.
//    - When a user enters invalid payment information (e.g., expired card, incorrect CVV), they should be shown an appropriate error message and not be allowed to proceed.
//    - When a user successfully completes the payment, they should be shown a confirmation page with their order details and an estimated delivery date.
//    - When a user decides to change quantities or remove items from the cart during checkout, the cart summary should update accordingly.
